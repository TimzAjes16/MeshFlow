Fix: Resolve infinite refresh loop in Node Editor Panel

Problem:
- Every node update dispatched a refreshWorkspace event
- This triggered WorkspaceProvider to reload workspace data
- Store updates caused re-renders, creating an infinite loop
- User edits would cause continuous refreshing

Solution:
- Removed all window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('refreshWorkspace')) calls
  from update operations in NodeEditorPanel.tsx
- Leveraged existing optimistic update pattern for instant UI feedback
- Relying on existing 5-second polling for cross-client sync

Changes:
- Removed 12 refreshWorkspace dispatches from:
  * Title updates
  * Content updates (debounced)
  * Tag updates
  * Image settings updates
  * Chart settings updates
  * Shape settings updates
  * Text settings updates

Benefits:
- ✅ No more refresh loops
- ✅ Real-time updates with optimistic UI feedback
- ✅ Changes persist after 500ms debounce
- ✅ Smooth editing experience
- ✅ Cross-client sync still works via polling

Files modified:
- components/NodeEditorPanel.tsx
- CHANGELOG.md (added comprehensive documentation)
